## 0.11.0

### Forked from html2pdf.js

- Forked from html2pdf.js with these improvements:

  - Using html2canvas-pro instead of html2canvas for better rendering
  - Use modern build formats (ESM, CommonJS), but always build bundled with dependencies
  - Simplified package configuration
  - Updated docs to show how to use in modern JS environments
